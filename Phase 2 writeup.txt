Phase 1 Writeup

I. Additional Tasks for Grading: 1.8, 1.9. 1.10

II. Code Change Description:

Task 1.1
Added more unit tests in the DataManager.createFund method, created separate JUnit test
classes in the DataManager’s attemptLogin and getContributorName methods, achieving 100%
statement coverage in all those three methods.

Task 1.2
There are spelling errors in DataManager class. I fixed the error in "get("description")
in "String description = (String)data.get("description");", as well as change "Contributr"
to "Contributor" in "String response = client.makeRequest("/findContributorNameById", map);"
by using JUnit test and finding that the assert results are not equal to expected results.

Task 1.3
Added if loops and try-catch blocks to handle input error handling in UserInterface.start().
Added print statement to notify user of error and re-prompt user for new inputs.

Task 1.4
The total amount donated is calculated by summing up the amounts from each donation.
The percentage of the target is calculated by the total donations / the target amount.

Task 1.8
Put existing code in a while loop so that we can restart the loop if user enters invalid
input. Used if loops to filter invalid user inputs and restart the user interaction with
re-prompt messages.

Task 1.9
Modified the DataManager.attemptLogin() so that it throws an IllegalStateException when
"status" is not "success", which occurs when error occurs while communicating with the
server, and modified UserInterface.main() by adding try-catch command. If an exception
was caught, it displays “Error in communicating with server” in this case but still
shows “Login fails” with username/password combination errors.

Task 1.10
The date is parsed using DateTimeFormatter.ISO_DATE_TIME and 
formatted using DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern("MMMM dd, yyyy"). 
The new date will be displayed in a format like "June 18, 2021."
