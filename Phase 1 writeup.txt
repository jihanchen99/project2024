Task 1.3
Added if loops and try-catch blocks to handle input error handling in UserInterface.start().
Added print statement to notify user of error and re-prompt user for new inputs.

Task 1.4
The total amount donated is calculated by summing up the amounts from each donation.
The percentage of the target is calculated by the total donations / the target amount.

Task 1.8
Put existing code in a while loop so that we can restart the loop if user enters invalid

re-prompt messages.

The date is parsed using DateTimeFormatter.ISO_DATE_TIME and 
formatted using DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern("MMMM dd, yyyy").
